# DICSS
Directly injected CSS

Forget SASS. Forget LESS. What you want is DICSS. Once you've had DICSS, you won't settle for LESS.

## How to use DICSS
Just grab DICSS and stick it wherever you like. DICSS works equally well in your `<head>` or in your `<body>`. The rest works itself out. Advanced users have even been putting DICSS in their back-end.

## Is it safe?
Don't worry. DICSS uses a wrapper.
